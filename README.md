Detection people wearing mask
You only look once, or YOLO, is one of the faster object detection algorithms out there.
Though it is no longer the most accurate object detection algorithm, it is a very good choice when you need an easy implementation, without loss of too much accuracy.
Prepare a Folder containing all the Images and its annotations in a folder.
Make sure you have selected hardware acceleration as GPU if you are using googe colab.
